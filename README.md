# Restaurant Reviews

This is project 5 for Udacity's front end nanodegree program. I was given a very poorly designed, inaccessible website and charged with making it responsive, incorporating accessibility guidelines, and coding a service worker to cache pages for offline use after visiting.

## Responsiveness
Page is now designed using mobile first principles. It displays well on small cell phones, large cell phones and tablets, as well as a desktop.

## Accessibility
We follow a11y guidelines put forth by the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) to help users navigate using screen reader technologies.

## Offline First
This application is also offline first, and will cache assets and serve them when network calls cannot be made.

## Mapping
We utilize [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to render and dispaly the mapping application.

## Contributing
This code was submitted for an academic project. Please use it for your benefit, but I will not accept pull requests.
